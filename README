This repository contains various scripts that I had to develop
at some point for various usages.

arpwatch-irc-email.pl
=====================

This script is doing a gateway between an arpwatch mailbox under the mbox
format and an irc channel. The idea was to be warned whenever a station's
MAC address on a LAN is changing, so that people can spot the culprit
quite quickly.
